This competition focuses on the creation of a WhatsApp chatbot designed to enhance the quality of teaching and communication between students and teachers.

Our proposal introduces a cutting-edge smart chatbot that leverages natural language processing and utilizes the advanced LLM framework. We implement innovative strategies derived from the LLM framework, which include:

Prompt Engineering,
Chain of Thought & Tree of Thought,
Function Calling,
Integration of Human Involvement

One innovative application is leveraging Language Model (LLM) to autonomously analyze database systems, generate SQL queries for data retrieval, and produce JSON for streamlined chart plotting.

We invite you to review our presentation (PPT) for a detailed demonstration and more information.
